/**
 *  The rotor dynamics is modeled as a first-order lag system.
 * 
 *  Input(s) ...  duty rate(0..1)
 *  Output(s) ... Omega in radian/sec
 *  Output(s)/Input(s) = G(s), G(s) = Kr/(Tr s + 1). 
 * 
 *  See: Nonami's book eq.(2.48)
 * 
 *  Kr ... gain constant, which is the coefficient of the duty rate to the radian/sec.
 *        and it is the maximum radian/sec of duty 1.0 as time equals infinity.
 *  Tr ... time constant of the rotor.
 * 
 *  Note that the above first-order lag model is originally not for raw Omega,
 *  but for Delta-Omega, the difference from the Omega0 (the hover equiblium omega).
 *  But this model usually works fare. Possibliy make a non-linear model in the future.
 * 
 *  MAKE SURE that the unit of the simulation delta time be smaller than Tr.
 *  Otherwise, the simulation will be unstable. 
 *  (The target Kr*(duty rate) == Omega is reached in one iteration)
 * 
 *  By inverse Laplace transform, we get the following equation.
 *  (this function returns the lhs of the equation)
 * 
 *     d(Omega)/dt = ( Kr * (duty rate) - (Omega) ) / Tr
 * 
 *  If the input duty rate is a constant, the analytical solution for
 *  the above equation is as follows(step response).;
 * 
 *     Omega = Kr * (1 - exp(-t/Tr) * (duty rate))

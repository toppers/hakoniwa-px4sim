## About the Unit
- **Newton-meter (Nm)**: The SI unit of torque, representing the force applied at a distance from the rotation axis.


## Interpreting Torque

Torque plays a crucial role in controlling the attitude of a drone. The following rotational torques along different axes are considered:

* **Roll Torque (φ direction)**: The force that rotates the drone around its lateral axis (side to side).
* **Pitch Torque (θ direction)**: The force that rotates the drone around its longitudinal axis (front to back).
* **Yaw Torque (ψ direction)**: The force that rotates the drone around its vertical axis (up and down).

These torques are controlled by the forces generated by the drone's rotors. By adjusting the speed and direction of rotation of the rotors, the drone can modulate the torque around each axis to achieve the desired changes in posture.

The drone's flight control system precisely adjusts these torques to realize specific attitudes and flight patterns. Understanding and controlling these torques are essential for stable flight and precise maneuvers.

# 1. About This Document

This document explains how to use the Windows installer for the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator and verify the operation of sample applications using the Python API.

## 1.1. Target Environment

This document assumes the following OS version and PC environment (recommended):

| No  | Target | Details                            |
| --- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | OS     | Windows 10/11                      |
| 2   | PC     | 64-bit environment                 |
| 3   | PC     | Core i7 9th generation or later    |
| 4   | PC     | 32GB memory (recommended)          |
| 5   | PC     | SSD with 512GB or more             |
| 6   | PC     | Graphics accelerator (recommended) |

## 1.2. Prerequisites

A RAM Disk must be installed. Please complete the installation of the RAM Disk following the steps below.
A Python environment must also be installed. Please check the steps below to complete the installation.

### 1.2.1. About the RAM Disk Environment

The RAM Disk is used for data sharing between various components. Since the standard Windows environment does not have tools for creating a RAM Disk, it is necessary to use free tools.
Among the various RAM Disk tools for Windows, we will use "ImDisk" for Windows 10 or 11, as it seems to have no usage restrictions.

[Reference site for comparing RAM Disk tools for Windows](https://ik4.es/en/how-to-create-a-ram-disk-in-windows-10-8-and-windows-7/)

We will use "ImDisk" due to licensing and usage restrictions.

### 1.2.2. Installing ImDisk Toolkit

Access the official ImDisk page to obtain the ImDisk environment.

[Official ImDisk Toolkit page (SourceForge)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/)

![How to get ImDisk Toolkit](./ramdisk/rd11-en.png)

Download the ImDisk Toolkit, extract the "ImDiskTk-x64.zip" file, and double-click "install.bat" to start the installer. Follow the GUI instructions to complete the installation.

![How to install ImDisk Toolkit](./ramdisk/rd12-en.png)

Once the installation is complete, icons related to ImDisk Toolkit will appear on the desktop. Double-click the "RamDisk Configuration" icon to open the configuration screen. Set the following values and click the OK button to complete.

| No  | Setting      | Value        |
| --- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1   | Size         | Specify 64MB |
| 2   | Drive Letter | Specify Z:   |
| 3   | File System  | Specify NTFS |

![RamDisk Configuration Settings](./ramdisk/rd13-en.png)

After the configuration is complete, a warning regarding Windows power settings may appear. In this case, uncheck the "Fast startup" checkbox in the power settings and restart Windows.

![Windowsの電源設定](./ramdisk/rd14.png)

After the restart, a RAM Disk will be created.

![RamDisk Settings Done](./ramdisk/rd15.png)

[Reference site for ImDisk setup: Building an ultra-comfortable environment with RAM Disk](https://avalon-studio.work/blog/windows/ram-disk-configration/)

### 1.2.3. Setting Up for Hakoniwa Simulator

Hakoniwa Simulator uses a folder called "mmap" on the RAM Disk. Since the "mmap" folder disappears after a Windows restart or shutdown, it is necessary to set up ImDisk Toolkit to create the folder during startup.

Create an "mmap.bat" file with the following contents:

```txt
z:
mkdir mmap
```

Save the "mmap.bat" file in an appropriate location. Then double-click "RamDisk Configuration" to start it.

When the RamDisk Configuration screen appears, click the "Advanced" tab. In the "Run after mounting" section, specify the previously created "mmap.bat" file. Click the OK button to complete.

![Set a batchfile path for mmap folder creating](./ramdisk/rd16-en.png)

### 1.2.4. Installing Python Environment

Access the official Python page to obtain the Python environment for Windows.

[Official Python page](https://www.python.org/)

![Download Python](./python/Python11-en.png)

Click to start the download automatically. After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

![Install Python](./python/Python12-en.png)

# 2. About the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Windows Installer

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Windows installer was developed using Microsoft's Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition IDE. It is intended for open source and personal use only. Licensing terms and conditions follow Microsoft's license.

[Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition License Terms](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/license-terms/vs2022-ga-community/)

[Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition Redistribution Terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/redistribution)

# 3. Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Windows Installation Procedure

Download the zip file from the Releases page and extract it to an appropriate folder.

## 3.1. Running the Installer

Move to the folder where the zip file was extracted. The files "setup.exe" and "hakowin.msi" should be extracted. The contents of these files are as follows:

| No  | File Name   | Description                                              |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | setup.exe   | Setup executable for installing Hakoniwa Drone Simulator |
| 2   | hakowin.msi | Complete package for installing Hakoniwa Drone Simulator |

Once these files are extracted, right-click on "setup.exe" and click "Run as administrator."

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Installer 1](./hakoinst/inst1-en.png)

The Hakowin Setup Wizard will start. Click "Next."

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Installer 2](./hakoinst/inst2-en.png)

In the installation folder selection screen, click "Next."

**Note:** Although you can select the installation folder and user, please proceed without changing these settings.

In the hakoniwa drone config file screen, leave the radio button for the config file at the default setting, then click "Next."

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Installer 3](./hakoinst/inst3-en.png)

Click "Next" in the installation confirmation screen, and wait for the progress bar to complete. Once completed, click "Next" and then click "Finish" to close.

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator Installer 4](./hakoinst/inst4-en.png)

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator environment is now installed.

The installation destination is as follows:

```txt
C:\Users\"Username"\Documents\hakoniwa\hakowin\hakoniwa-px4-win
```

# 4. Preparations for Python Simulation

To run simulations using Python, it is necessary to install the required libraries for Python.

## 4.1. Installing Python Libraries

Start PowerShell in administrator mode from the Windows Start menu.

![Launch Powershell](./hakoinst/hakowin23-en.png)

Use the pip command to install the following libraries:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\System32> pip install pygame
PS C:\Windows\System32> pip install numpy
PS C:\Windows\System32> pip install opencv-python
```

# 5. Running Sample Apps for Python API

Once installation is complete, a "hakowin" folder will be created on the desktop. This folder contains shortcuts for the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator environment and sample apps for Python API.

![Hakoniwa Drone Sim Sample App 1](./hakoinst/inst5-en.png)

## 5.1. Contents of the hakowin Folder

The "hakowin" folder contains core functions, Unity drone models, and sample applications for Hakoniwa Drone Simulator.

# 6. Troubleshooting

The Hakoniwa Drone Simulator environment installed by the installer may encounter some issues. Please review your environment settings if you encounter the following problems.

## 6.1. If Environment Variables Are Not Set

If the installation is not performed with administrative privileges, environment variables may not be set. This can cause errors as shown below.

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator sample troubleshooting 1](./hakoinst/troubleshooting1-en.png)

In this case, uninstall the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator and reinstall it with administrative privileges.

## 6.2. If Ramdisk Is Not Configured Properly

If the RAM Disk is not configured correctly, errors as shown below may occur.

![Hakoniwa Drone Simulator sample troubleshooting 2](./hakoinst/troubleshooting2-en.png)

In this case, review the pre-installation steps carefully and verify the RAM Disk settings.

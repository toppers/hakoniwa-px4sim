# Features

1. **Physics-based Plant Model:** Drone behavior is represented by high-precision models based on physics. Developed in C language, it seamlessly integrates with PX4. For more details, please refer [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/drone_physics). It is capable of simulating physical reactions in real-time during collisions with obstacles (`v1.1.0`). For more details, see [here](#collision-with-obstacles).

2. **Visualization via Game Engines:** The visual representation of drones is realized using game engines. This visualization serves as an aid to physical simulations, primarily aimed at visualization purposes. Visual representation of collisions with obstacles is also possible (`v1.1.0`). For more details, see [here](#collision-with-obstacles).

3. **Engine Flexibility:** Currently supports the Unity engine, but the architecture is designed to enable integration with other game engines as well. A plugin for integration with Unreal Engine is available [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-unreal-simasset-plugin/tree/main) (`v1.1.0`).

4. **Compatibility with MATLAB/Simulink:** The physics model can be integrated with models created in MATLAB/Simulink. For more details, see [here](#integration-with-matlab).

5. **Sensor Model Organization:** Sensor models are organized within the architecture based on clear specifications. This allows users to exchange sensor models according to the specifications. For each sensor specification, please refer [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/docs/phys_specs).„ÄÄFor instructions on how to create sensors for each vendor, please refer to [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/blob/main/drone_sensors/README.md).

6. **Headless Support:** Simulation can be run without Unity. This enables simulation execution in environments that do not require a graphical interface. For more details, see [here](#headless-simulation).

7. **Support for Automated Testing:** Enables test scenario-based automated testing. This makes it possible to automate repeated and consecutive tests, thereby streamlining the development process. For more details, please refer [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/px4/auto-test).

8. **External Parameterization of Aircraft Characteristics:** The characteristics of the drone can be parameterized externally. This allows for simulations tailored to various aircraft characteristics, enabling support for a wider range of test scenarios. For an example of parameter settings, see [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/blob/main/hakoniwa/config/api_sample/drone_config_0.json).

9. **Multi-Aircraft Support:** By preparing multiple sets of drone airframe characteristic parameters, it is possible to simulate several aircraft simultaneously. For details, see [here](#Multi-Aircraft-Support).

10. **Python API Support:** It's possible to control the aircraft via the Python API without using PX4 or QGC. For details, see [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/blob/main/drone_api/README.md). Additionally, you can control the drone using a PS4 controller. For more details, please visit [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/docs/drone_control/ps4). For an explanation of the control program driven by the Python API, please refer to [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/docs/drone_control).

11. **Log Replay:** You can replay the flight trajectory of the drones from the log data recorded during the drone simulation execution. For more details, see [here](#logreplay).

12. **Support for Environmental Factors:** The drone simulation includes environmental factors such as wind, temperature, and humidity. These factors can be externally defined, allowing disturbances like wind to affect the drone's trajectory. Environmental factors can be configured according to the simulation scenario. For sample implementations and configuration files for the environmental models, refer to [this document](docs/drone_environment/README.md).

13. **Support for AR Devices:** By wearing an AR device, you can experience the drone being simulated in Hakoniwa in real-time right in front of you. For more details, see [here](#Support-for-AR-Devices).

14. **Web Browser Support:** You can visualize the Hakoniwa Drone Simulation in a web browser. The visualization is made possible by registering the Hakoniwa Web Server as a Hakoniwa asset. The Hakoniwa Web Server shares Hakoniwa PDU data (such as the drone‚Äôs position information) through WebSocket, allowing real-time visualization of the data in a web browser. For setup and usage instructions for the Hakoniwa Web Server, see [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-webserver).

15. **Support for Battery:** It is possible to simulate the battery voltage model for Hakoniwa drones. The battery voltage model can be configured using the aircraft parameters. When the battery level drops below a certain threshold, the drone's flight becomes restricted. For details on how to configure the battery voltage model see [here](#Support-for-Battery).

# Integration with MATLAB

From version v2.0.0 onwards, the feature to generate code from models created in MATLAB/Simulink and simulate them on Hakoniwa has been supported.

Currently, the supported features are as follows:

- [X] Drone Physics Model
- [ ] Sensor Model
- [ ] Actuator Model

## Overview of the Development Flow

The process of migrating models from MATLAB/Simulink to the Hakoniwa simulation environment is as illustrated below.

Currently, the flow involves constructing drone physics models for a predefined C interface in Hakoniwa. Future updates are planned to develop the workflow further, including interface definitions and incorporating sensors/actuators.

![Screenshot 2024-01-31 13 49 04](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/assets/164193/be7e404f-c6b4-4b2a-8545-aec4239f7043)

* MATLAB/Simulink Hakoniwa Templates
  * Interfaces for MATLAB/Simulink models are defined on the Hakoniwa side. For more details, see [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/blob/main/matlab-if/README.md).
  * Templates for connecting MATLAB/Simulink models to Hakoniwa are provided. For more details, see [here](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/matlab-if/model_template).
* MATLAB/Simulink Process
  * With the Hakoniwa input/output interfaces defined in the template, create a model that converts input data to output data.
  * Simulate and check the created model in MATLAB.
  * After verifying the simulation in MATLAB, generate C code.
* Hakoniwa Simulation Process
  * Place the generated C code under `matlab-if` in hakoniwa-px4sim.
  * Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` under `matlab-if` to include it in the build targets (inside the `HAKONIWA_MATLAB_BUILD` block).
  * Compile according to the Hakoniwa build process.
  * Once compilation is successful, proceed with the simulation according to the Hakoniwa simulation execution process.

# Effects from the Environment

From version v1.1.0 onwards, it is possible for the drone in the simulation environment to be affected by external environmental factors.

For instance, using a game engine, it is possible to simulate in real-time the physical impact of a drone colliding with an obstacle.

The current support situation is as follows:

- [X] Collision with obstacles
- [ ] Impact of wind
- [ ] Effects of direct sunlight

## Collision with Obstacles

By placing obstacles within the game engine, information about the aircraft's interaction with these obstacles can be fed back to the physical model.

To use this feature, set the `collision_detection` parameter in `droneDynamics` to `true`.

Example of settings:

```json
      "droneDynamics": {
          "physicsEquation": "BodyFrame",
          "collision_detection": true,
          "manual_control": false,
          "airFrictionCoefficient": [ 0.0001, 0.0 ],
          "inertia": [ 0.0000625, 0.00003125, 0.00009375 ],
          "mass_kg": 0.1,
          "body_size": [ 0.1, 0.1, 0.01 ],
          "position_meter": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
          "angle_degree": [ 0, 0, 0 ]
        },
```

Example of execution:

https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/assets/164193/c1305966-d782-42f4-bd5b-13c57b1ff726


# Headless Simulation

In Hakoniwa, drones can be tested for PID control without the use of Unity and PX4 (headless simulation). This is convenient for checking the operation of the drone dynamics you have created.

Here are the two methods for creating programs with headless simulation:

1. [Method of building and integrating with the sandbox build process]((https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/hakoniwa/src/assets/drone/controller))
2. [Method of integrating as a loadable module](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-px4sim/tree/main/drone_control)

# Multi-Aircraft Support

By preparing multiple sets of drone airframe characteristic parameters, it is possible to simulate several aircraft simultaneously.

## Preliminary Preparation

To simulate multiple aircraft simultaneously, the following preliminary preparations are required:

* [Setting of airframe characteristic parameters](#Setting-of-airframe-characteristic-parameters)
* [Unity settings](#Unity-settings)
* [PX4 settings](#PX4-settings)
* [QGC settings](#QGC-settings)

### Setting of Airframe Characteristic Parameters

Example: For two aircraft
```
hakoniwa/config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drone_config_0.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ drone_config_1.json
```

The format for the airframe parameter files should be as follows:

* `drone_config_<index>.json`
* `<index>` should be a sequential number starting from 0.

For each aircraft's parameters, please set the following items appropriately:

* name
  * Match the name with the Unity aircraft name. Example: DroneAvatar1
* components.droneDynamics.position_meter
  * Set the initial position of the aircraft. Specify a location that does not overlap with other aircraft.

### Unity Settings

1. In the Unity editor, place drone avatars for each set of aircraft parameters. The drone avatar name and the "name" in the aircraft parameters must match.
2. In the Unity editor, execute `Generate`, then copy and place the generated `custom.json` from `hakoniwa-unity-drone-model` into `hakoniwa/config/custom.json`.

### PX4 Settings

To launch PX4 in multiple instances, you need to prepare the PX4 filesystem for each aircraft.

Copy and place the existing build directory as follows:

Example: For two aircraft
```
cd px4/PX4-Autopilot
cp -rp build build-0
cp -rp build build-1
```

The format for the build directory name should be:

* `build-<index>`
* `<index>` should be a sequential number starting from 0.

### QGC Settings

Add port numbers for the second and subsequent aircraft in the communication link settings.

The port number should be `18570 + <index>`, where `<index>` is a sequential number starting from 0.

## How to Run the Simulation

The method for running the simulation is the same as for a single aircraft.

However, PX4 needs to be launched for each aircraft, so please start it with the following command, specifying the aircraft number:

```
bash ../sim/simstart.bash <index>
```

Example: For the first aircraft
```
bash ../sim/simstart.bash 0
```

Example: For the second aircraft
```
bash ../sim/simstart.bash 1
```

# LogReplay

In the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator, logs are recorded for each drone during simulation execution.

The log file is located at `hakoniwa-px4sim/hakoniwa/drone_log0/drone_dynamics.csv`.

Using this log information, you can replay the flight trajectory of the drones.

The log replay should be executed in the same directory where the simulation was run (`hakoniwa-px4sim/hakoniwa`).

Additionally, it is assumed that `hakoniwa-unity-drone-model` is in the same directory hierarchy as `hakoniwa-px4sim`.

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hakoniwa-unity-drone-model
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hakoniwa-px4sim
```

To execute the log replay, follow these steps:

```
bash replay.bash
```

Start Unity for `hakoniwa-unity-drone-model` and begin the simulation. The drones will replicate the movements from the original simulation.


# Support for AR Devices

Using an AR device, you can visualize the drone being simulated in real-time, allowing you to experience its behavior in the physical space right in front of you. This enables users to directly observe the simulation results, creating a unique interaction between the simulated and real-world environments.

## Required Equipment
- **Oculus Quest 3** or another supported AR device
- **PC** (with Unity development environment installed)
- **Hakoniwa Drone Simulator** (AR-supported version)

## Detailed Steps
To experience the drone simulation using an AR device, you will need to create a dedicated app. For instructions and required settings, please refer to the links below:

- [Steps for creating a Quest 3 app](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-unity-drone-model/blob/main/README-quest3.md)
- [How to link the Hakoniwa Drone Simulator with an AR app](https://github.com/toppers/hakoniwa-unity-drone-model/blob/main/README-quest3-drone.md)

# Support for Battery

You can simulate the battery voltage model for Hakoniwa drones. The battery voltage model can be configured through the aircraft parameters. When the battery level falls below a certain threshold, the drone's flight will be restricted.

The following steps outline how to configure the battery voltage model:


## Add Battery Voltage Model Settings to `drone_config_<id>.json`

```json
      "battery": {
        "vendor": "None",
        "model": "linear",
        "BatteryModelCsvFilePath": "./config/battery_model.csv",
        "VoltageLevelGreen": 12.1, 
        "VoltageLevelYellow": 11.1,
        "CapacityLevelYellow": 3, 
        "NominalVoltage": 14.8,
        "NominalCapacity": 4.0,
        "EODVoltage": 3.0
      }
```

The `model` parameter allows you to choose from three types of battery voltage models:

- `constant`: A model where the voltage remains constant.
- `linear`: A model where the voltage decreases linearly.
- `custom`: A model defined using a CSV file.

If you select the `custom` model, specify the path to the CSV file in `BatteryModelCsvFilePath`.


## Voltage Level Settings

- `VoltageLevelGreen`: Minimum value [V] for the Green voltage level.
- `VoltageLevelYellow`: Minimum value [V] for the Yellow voltage level.
- `CapacityLevelYellow`: Minimum capacity [Ah] for the Yellow capacity level.


## Voltage Model Parameters

- `NominalVoltage`: Nominal voltage [V], the standard operating voltage of the battery.
- `NominalCapacity`: Nominal capacity [Ah], the theoretical amount of charge the battery can supply.
- `EODVoltage`: End-of-discharge voltage [V].


## Create the `battery_model.csv` File

If you select `custom` for the `model`, define the battery voltage model in the file specified by `BatteryModelCsvFilePath`.

**Example Configuration:**

| Temperature (¬∞C) | Discharge Capacity (Ah) | Voltage (V) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 45                | 0.0                     | 14.8        |
